Physics scripting from here:
* http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=PhysicsFPSWalker

Friction Materials
* http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-PhysicMaterial.html

Tools used:
* Orthello2d : http://www.wyrmtale.com/products/unity3d-components/orthello
** In order to get Orthello to work with JS, you must move the Assets/Orthello/StandardAssets to Assets/StandardAssets. And you must move the folder *within* Unity3D. If you move it in the OS, it will break everything.
* Texture Packer : http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker
